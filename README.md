topics of discussion:

We discussed the possibilities that the bottom comment-bar of the <section> element could actually be designed as a button, nesting an <svg> element as well as a <P> (for "comment")
and the "+" svg can transform into a "-" while it opens up a comment section for us to add more notes to the <p class="comment-input"> element.
