topics of discussion:

We discussed the possibilities that the bottom comment-bar of the <section> element could actually be designed as a button, nesting an <svg> element as well as a <P> (for "comment")
and the "+" svg can transform into a "-" while it opens up a comment section for us to add more notes to the <p class="comment-input"> element.

### End of Day Retros
- Monday 07/25: Went over our HTML and how it was implemented, points where we could refactor and went over naming conventions for classes and ids.
- Tuesday 07/26: Started our CSS file and creating rules based on class-name selectors, starting with containers and working inward.
- Wednesday 07/27: Finished the CSS file with flex-box elements, did some experimenting with overflow at the bottom of the page and ultimately added a scroll wheel to the idea-card section. Will continue to refactor and play with options when JS functionality is complete. Started implementing Solo Project Common Feedback into our project, refactoring as needed and as we notice where we can improve. Also completed Iteration 1, creating the idea.js and main.js files.
- Thursday 07/28: Continue to apply feedback from our previous projects as we work through Iteration 2, adding our selectors, event handlers, beginning functions for save-button functionality in the main-section.
